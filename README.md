# AMS-KinectSensorDance
[Stilll in development] A Web Application, made with Unity, that takes skeletal data recorded using a Kinect v2 depth sensor and produces a 3D rendering that can be viewed and playbacked from multiple angles. We have also moved onto Phase 2 which involves algorithmic comparisons, and working out ways to produce a likeness score between an 'ideal' dance and a recorded dance.
